# ROEngines-Extended

This is an expansion to RO-Engines and really to RO as a whole. **ROEngines is required to use this mod**. This mod adds many engines that lack quality models, or models at all, for use in ROEngines. All of these engines are based off of real, scientific studies and papers. The hope with this project going forwards is to flesh out the RP-1 Tech tree which seemed lacking towards the later game. I hope you enjoy and please feel free to make a pull request if you need any help or find any bugs :)
