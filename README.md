# ROEngines-Extended

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/N39nSOh.jpg?1)

This is an expansion to RO-Engines and really to RO as a whole. This mod includes a host of mid to late game speculative engines to the RP-1
Tech tree. All of these engines are based off of real, scientific studies and papers. The hope with this project going forwards is to flesh 
out the RP-1 Tech tree which seemed lacking towards the later game. I hope you enjoy and please feel free to make a pull request if you need
any help or find any bugs :)
