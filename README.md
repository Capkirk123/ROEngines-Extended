# ROEngines-Extended

## What is it?

ROEnginesExtended is a mod that takes parts from ROEngines and clones them to create placeholders for other parts. The models aren't always the most accurate, but it should allow for many otherwise unrepresented engines to be used ingame.

## Why is it needed?

Historically, Realism Overhaul has been a mod that provides only config files that change the sizes and values of existing parts from stock and mods. This has allowed the mod to represent many different parts and engines that existed historically. Often, these models are only close approximation of what the real life engines look like. Other times, these models are not accurate at all and are only used in order to fill a niche that is needed.

ROEngines aims to solve this problem with a carefully curated selection of engine parts and a patching system that removes duplicate parts, but some engines lack any representation at all in the KSP modding community.

ROEnginesExtended creates lightweight placeholders for these engines by tweaking existing ROEngines parts, hopefully resulting in something much nicer than just rescaled stock parts.

## Who deserves the credit?

All the modders that used their time and considerable skills to develop the models, animations and textures that you see represented in game. Each part that is included inlcudes reference to the original modder that created the part. In all situations I have respected the licenses (as far as I know) and where authors could be reached, I received permission to include them. If you find anything that you do not think should belong, please let me know and I will remove them.
